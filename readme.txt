Display Amazon.com customer reviews for products you specify in WordPress pages or posts, or as a widget.

== Description ==

The ScrapeAZon plugin displays Amazon.com customer reviews of specific products that you choose. You must be a participant in both the Amazon.com Affiliate Program and the Amazon.com Product Advertising API in order to use this plugin. You can join the Amazon.com Affiliate Program by following the instructions at the program page. You can join the Product Advertising API by following the instructions at the Product Advertising API page.

Features:

* Uses a shortcode to display customer reviews for a specific Amazon product.
* Reviews iframe can be styled manually from the shortcode, via custom CSS, or via a built-in responsive style sheet.
* Includes an "Amazon Reviews" widget that can be used in place of or in addition to the shortcode.
* Supports WordPress localization (i18n)
* Can pull reviews from Amazon International sites, not just Amazon.com (US). 
* Implements the latest version of the Amazon.com API.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Obtain an AWS Access Key ID, an AWS Secret Key, and an Amazon.com Affiliate ID, if you don't already have them
2. If you have a previous version of ScrapeAZon installed, deactivate and delete it from the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
3. Upload the ScrapeAZon folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
4. Activate ScrapeAZon by using the 'Plugins' menu
5. Click ScrapeAZon from the Wordpress Settings menu and configure the appropriate settings
6. Add the <code>[scrapeazon asin="<amazon.com product number>"]</code> shortcode, where <amazon.com product number> is the ASIN or ISBN-10 of the product that contains the reviews you want to display, to the pages or posts you want. For example, if you wanted to display reviews for a product with the ASIN of 012345689, you would issue the shortcode <code>[scrapeazon asin="0123456789"]</code>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I want to use this plugin? =

ScrapeAZon serves a very specific requirement. It was primarily developed to enable an Amazon vendor to display Amazon.com customer reviews on a product page that is styled independently of other item and product information that is available by using the Amazon.com API.

If you don't want to insert an entire Amazon.com product entry into your site, you can use this plugin to simply incorporate Amazon.com customer reviews onto your existing product page.

= What makes version 2.x different from the 1.x version of ScrapeAZon? =

ScrapeAZon has been rewritten from the ground up to more closely integrate with Wordpress. Additionally, this version of the plugin include several new features, such as:

* An option to style the plugin output for sites that use a responsive design.
* A widget that can be used in place of or in addition to the shortcode.
* An exponential backoff mechanism that attempts to mitigate throttling of high-traffic sites by the Amazon API. 

= What is an ASIN? =

An ASIN is an Amazon.com product identification number. ScrapeAZon uses this identifier to download the correct customer reviews that are associated with a product. An ASIN can be assigned by Amazon.com or, in case of a book, the 10-character version of the ISBN.

= Can I use an identifier other than an ASIN to retrieve reviews? =

Yes, as of ScrapeAZon 2.0.1, you can replace the asin parameter in a shortcode with any of the following parameters:

* <code>isbn</code>
* <code>upc</code>
* <code>ean</code>
* <code>sku</code>

The isbn parameter enables you to retrieve reviews for a book or an ebook by using an International Standard Book Number (ISBN). For example, you could use an ISBN retrieve reviews for Stephen King's 11/22/63 by using the following shortcode:

<code>[scrapeazon isbn="9781451627299"]</code>

The upc parameter enables you to retrieve reviews for a product based on that product's Universal Product Code (UPC).

The ean parameter enables you to retrieve reviews for a product based on that product's European Article Number (EAN).

The sku parameter enables you to retrieve reviews for a product based that product’s stock keeping unit (SKU).

= Why do I need to sign up for an Amazon Affiliate account? =

Amazon's API requires an affiliate account id in order to correctly process requests and download information about item lookups.

= Why do I need to sign up for Amazon Product Advertising API? =

Amazon's API requires an AWS Access Key ID and an AWS Secret Key in order to correctly process requests and download information about item lookups. You cannot obtain this information unless you sign up for an account.

= Can I use a user-specific (IAM) access key id and secret key with this plugin? =

No. As of this writing, Amazon's Product Advertising API does not support the use of IAM credentials. Therefore, you must use your root Access Key ID and Secret Key in order to successfully obtain product reviews. If you have already created root credentials and are no longer able to access your Secret Key, you might need to generate a new root key in the Amazon AWS Security Console.

= Why is there a 0 at the end of my reviews? =

For an unknown reason, the Amazon Product Advertising API returns a 0 at the end of review text. If you have configured review truncation, you won’t see the 0 value at the end of truncated reviews. However, any review that is displayed in its entirety currently also displays a 0 at the end. This is an issue with the API. Therefore, the plugin cannot fix this issue beyond allowing you to truncate reviews.

= How do I truncate reviews to a specific character length? =

If you want all ScrapeAZon-retrieved reviews throughout your site to be truncated at a specific character length, you can specify that length on the Settings > ScrapeAZon page. You can override this global setting at the shortcode level by specifying a positive integer value using the `truncate` parameter. A value of 0 either globally or on the shortcode level causes the API to return the full text of every review.

= Can I disable the reviews summary so that readers do not see how many ratings each level has? =

Yes. Although the reviews summary is on by default, you can disable it by specifying `summary="false"` in the shortcode.

= Can I retrieve reviews from sites other than Amazon by using this plugin? =

No. This plugin currently only accesses reviews for products that are available through the Amazon.com Product Advertising API.

= Can I retrieve reviews from Amazon's international sites? =

Yes. Configure the shortcode's <code>country</code> parameter with the appropriate two-character country code to change the Amazon site. For example, to retrieve reviews for ISBN 0123456789 from Amazon UK, you could issue the following shortcode:

<code>[scrapeazon asin="0123456789" country="UK"]</code>

The country codes are as follows:

* AT: Austria (uses the German site)
* CA: Canada
* CN: China
* DE: Germany
* ES: Spain
* FR: France
* IN: India
* IT: Italy
* JP: Japan
* UK: United Kingdom
* US: United States (default)

You can also globally configure a country code on the ScrapeAZon Settings page instead of specifying one for each shortcode used on your site. If you globally configure a country code and specify a country code in your shortcode, the country code in the shortcode will take precedence.

= How do I use the ScrapeAZon Widget? =

Similar to most WordPress widgets, first click Appearance > Widgets from the Admin menu. Next, drag the widget named "Amazon Reviews" to the location in which you want it to display. Once you have placed the widget, you must fill in the "ASIN" field with the ASIN of the product that contains the reviews you want to display. You can optionally fill in the Height, Width, and Border fields. You can also retitle the widget if you like. Note that whatever global settings you have configured on the ScrapeAZon Settings pages also apply to the widget. Therefore, if you have selected Responsive mode, the widget will attempt to use a responsive style.

= ScrapeAZon isn't displaying *anything* on my page. What's up with that? =

Some common reasons you might see an error or nothing at all are:

* Your AWS Access Key ID has not been set or is incorrect.
* Your AWS Secret Key has not been set or is incorrect.
* Your Amazon.com Associate ID has not been set or is incorrect.
* You have not allowed enough time for your keys or IDs to propagate at Amazon.com.
* Your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Key are associated with an incorrect Amazon.com Product Advertising API account.
* Your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Key are not root keys.
* Your site's HTTP retrieval client was not able to connect to the Amazon API.
* Your site has sent too many requests per second to the Amazon Product Advertising API and Amazon has throttled your access.
* Your site caches the pages that display reviews for an extended period of time (longer than 24 hours).
* Your site's server date, time, or time zone are not properly configured.

If you know that reviews exist for the product you specified, ensure that the ASIN/ISBN-10 you provided in the shortcode is correct. Also, ensure that you are not viewing a previously cached version of your page that does not contain the shortcode.

= How do I style the iframe? =

There are several ways that you can style the scrapeazon-reviews iframe: by editing your theme's stylesheet, by adding parameters to each shortcode, or by using the plugin's built-in responsive style sheet.

To style the iframe in your theme's stylesheet, add classes named scrapeazon-reviews and scrapeazon-api to your stylesheet, then add the width, height, border, and other parameters you want to style to those classes. For example, copy and paste the following into your stylesheet to make the iframe a 540x540 pixel square with no border:

<code>.scrapeazon-reviews {
   width: 540px;
   height: 540px;
   border: none;
}
.scrapeazon-api {
   width: 540px;
}</code>

To style the iframe by using the shortcode, add width, height, and border as parameters to the shortcode. For example, to accomplish the same formatting as above in shortcode format, use the following shortcode:

<code>[scrapeazon asin="<your asin>" width="540" height="540" border="false"]</code>

Append a percent (%) symbol to the width and height values if you are specifying your those values in percentages rather than pixels. You can optionally append ‘px’ instead of the percent symbol to use pixels. If you specify digits only, ScrapeAZon will default to pixels.

To style the iframe by using the built-in responsive style sheet (if your site has a responsive design/theme), select the "Use Responsive Style" checkbox on the ScrapeAZon Settings page.

= I'm using the responsive stylesheet. Why does the content in the iframe scroll horizontally on very small screens? =

Because the iframe content comes from a different source than the iframe itself, the content does not always scale in a responsive way. On very small screens (such as a vertically held iPhone), the iframe itself will scale to the width of the screen in responsive mode. However, the content inside the iframe might need to be scrolled horizontally as well as vertically in order to read it.

= Can I get rid of that annoying disclaimer at the bottom of the iframe? =

If you know how to edit your theme's CSS, you probably can. However, doing so is not recommended unless you already manually display the disclaimer on your site. As of this writing, Amazon Services requires the disclaimer as part of its Product Advertising API terms.

As of ScrapeAZon 2.2.4, the Settings page now allows you to globally modify the text in the disclaimer.

= Can I at least style the disclaimer differently? =

If you want to use a different font, font size, or otherwise style the disclaimer, add a class named scrape-api to your theme's CSS file and make the changes within that class. For example, if you'd like the disclaimer to be in 9-point Helvetica and 540 pixels wide, you could add the following class to your CSS:

<code>.scrapeazon-api {
   width: 540px;
   font-family: Helvetica;
   font-size: 9pt;
}</code>

= What if I want to use iframe element attributes that are not supported by the shortcode? =

If you want more advanced control over the iframe, you can opt to issue the shortcode with the <code>url="true"</code> parameter. When set to "true," the <code>url</code> parameter prevents the plugin from displaying the iframe and instead simply returns the Amazon URL that should be included in the iframe's SRC attribute.

If you choose to issue the shortcode this way, you should do so between an iframe SRC attributes quotation marks in your page or post, as shown in the following example:

<code><iframe src="[scrapeazon isbn="9781451627299"  url="true"]"></iframe></code>

= Can I prevent the display of the iframe if there are no reviews yet for my products? =

Yes. By default, if the Amazon API returns no reviews for your product, ScrapeAZon will display the iframe that contains Amazon's "Be the first to review this item" page for the product you specified. If you want to prevent the display of that page, issue the shortcode with the <code>noblanks</code> parameter set to <code>true</code>, as shown in the following example:

<code>[scrapeazon isbn="9781451627299" noblanks="true"]</code>
